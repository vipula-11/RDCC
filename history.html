        <p>According to the folks in the area, It is said that this school was started between 1870 and 1875. It started
            as a coeducation center, We have hardly any Information about the founder or first teaching staff of this
            school. Because of inadequate saurces. But according to our ancestors there was a head master named Mr:
            Samarasinghe and he had two assistant Pedagogues at the bigining.</p>

        <p>Between 1920 – 1940 It started to hold Secondry and leaving examinations in the school. During the second
            World war all the school buildings were used as an Army camp and the school had to be shifted into another
            remote place close to Vihara junction. Unfortunately it caused the devastation of a very big and good
            collection of old books We had that time.
            In 1947 It became a junior school. Then the principal was Mr: S.B Ellepola and the medium of education was
            English. This important trend made a rapid increase in the number of students.A Small playground was added
            to the school then. The land where the school was situated , from the people Who lived around the school in
            this perioud.
        </p>

        <p>In 1955 We had 112 students and 04 teachers in this school Mr:K.H.S. Wickramarathna was the principal then he
            succeeded all his efforts to construct a new Science Laboratary and many new buildings. The school was
            Promoted as a senior school in 1958. To wards 1960 there were university entrance classes. Science , Music
            and commerce were the newly started classes. The sport ground extending more than three acres of land added
            to the school again. It started Various , student associations , Inter house sport meet in this time In the
            mean time new shrine room was opened in 06 march 1968 and a magnificent Buddha statue was enshrined in this
            shrine room. In 1967 our school was promoted to a senior Maha Vidyalaya Possition . Then there were 27
            teachers and 962 Students. After the retirement of Mr; Wickramarathne, Mr; G.S.B.Alagoda came to the office
            as principal. </p>

        <p>After Mr; Alagoda In 1968 Mr; H.M.I. Punchibanda was appointed as the principal. He ful filled many
            requirements of the school in his office time. He added two storied bullding and a dentel clinic to the
            school. In 1981 Mr; Edmond came to the office as the pricepal and he did a greater service in his time.
            Another two storied building , new science laboratory and teachers quarters were added to the school in his
            time. Also school was facilitated with electricity. After Mr; Edmond a principal named Mr; J.H.M.W. Ranjith
            came to the office as principal in 1993. Then the school was appointed to a central college. Then we started
            Boys scouts team , cadet teams , ST gohn Ambulance Service and volleyball in the school. The present
            progress of the school is after maths of all our past principals” services, sacrifices and courageos
            efforts. The parliament member of the area , Minister Mr; Janaka Bandara Tennakoan rendered his valuable
            service to fulfil all other requirments of the school.We have four houses named Vijaya , Gamunu , Parakum
            and Mahasen in our school. We held inter house sportsmeet annually. We do many sports as our extracurricular
            activities.</p>

        <p>IN 1999 Mr; D.M Walisundara was appointed as principal and he was transferred in 06 - 07 – 2000. Thereafter
            the vice principal Mr; K.G Mutubande acted as principal and in his time he succeeded to start building, new
            Auditorium. He worked until 05 – 01 – 2001. Then Mr; W.M Gunaratne Bandara became the principal. The
            protection wall of the college was built in his time. The school development society and the donors of the
            village lead this task. But the very first donation was given by Venarabel Inamaluva siri Sumangala theru,
            who is the chief incumbent of Dambulla golden temple and the chief of the Shiyamopali sector of Rangeri
            Dambulla. At the same time the stone walls and dranage System were buelt to stop the erosion of school
            premises. And it gave The further satisfaction of students. Thereafter Mr; I.H.M.C.B Herath came to the
            office as principal and the land next to school was added to the college by him. That is a very valuable
            task. </p>
